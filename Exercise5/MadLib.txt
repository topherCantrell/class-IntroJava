From the "Best of Mad Libs" by Roger Price and Leonard Stern

LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD

One day, Little _color_ Riding Hood was going through the forest carrying a
basket of _plural noun_ for her grandmother. Suddenly, she met a big _adjective_
wolf. 

"_exclamation_!" said the wolf. "Where are you going, little _silly word_?"

"I'm going to my grandmother's house," she said. 

Then the wolf _verb (past tense)_ away. When Miss Riding Hood got to her 
grandmother's house, the wolf was in bed dressed like her grandmother. 

"My, Grandmother," she said. "What big _plural noun 1_ you have." 

"The better to _verb 1_ you with," said the wolf. 

"And, Grandmother," she said, "what big _plural noun 2_ you have." 

The wolf said, "The better to _verb 2_ you with." 

And then she said, "What big _plural noun 3_ you have, Grandmother." 

But the wolf said nothing. He had just died of indigestion from eating Grandmother.
