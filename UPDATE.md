Make sure to talk about "String[] args" ane "String... args" being the same

Why is it so wordy to print? shows the modularness "System" and "out" and method. Other ways to simplify
it if you are doing a lot of printing. Maybe printing to console not as common outside of a classroom.

- Make sure all extra-info links are still good. Fix as needed.
- More demonstration videos
- Avoid making references to versions. It is easier to update the video than the audio.
