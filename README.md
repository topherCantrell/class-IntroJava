# Online Course

## Errata

- Course needs overhaul to modern versions in the lectures.
- Java added "modules" after this course was made. The course needs a lecture on modules and instructions on adding "maze.jar".
- The code in "maze.jar" is nowhere to be found! It needs to be recreated and doctored (no need for MazeUI).
